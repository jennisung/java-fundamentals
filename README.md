* Create a class to represent a Restaurant. Each Restaurant should have a name, a number of stars between 0 and 5, and a price category (i.e. number of dollar signs).
* Create a class to represent a Review. Each Review should have a body, an author, and a number of stars.
* A Review should be about a single Restaurant. Choose an implementation for this, and implement it. Some considerations:
* Add an instance method addReview to your Restaurant class. This method should take in a Review instance, and associate that review with this Restaurant. The specific methodology for this will vary, depending on the implementation you chose above.
